# SafeGuard AI
_(Transforming Safety with Real-Time Firearm Detection)_

## Introduction
Welcome to SafeGuard AI, an award-winning software solution that addresses a critical issue in today's society: firearm detection in real-time using computer vision. Our solution integrates seamlessly with existing camera systems to provide a 1ms response time for detecting firearms, ensuring immediate alerts and potentially saving lives. 

## Project Overview
### Problem Statement
In 2023 alone, the U.S. experienced 82 school shootings, with less than 1% of surveillance footage actively monitored 24/7. SafeGuard AI is designed to fill this critical gap in security.

### Solution
SafeGuard AI employs cutting-edge AI and transformative machine learning algorithms for real-time firearm detection and instant alerts to law enforcement and school officials. With a 1ms response time, our solution provides unparalleled security and peace of mind.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **Google Cloud A100 GPU**
- **Twilio API**
- **RTSP Streaming**
- **ONVIF SOAP Web Services**

## Features
- Real-time firearm detection with 1ms response time
- Immediate notification to school officials and law enforcement via Twilio API
- Seamless integration with existing camera systems
- Scalable to multiple surveillance systems

## Achievements
- **1st & 2nd Place** in two tech competitions ($1,750)
- **2nd Place** in a significant California-wide contest, outperforming top teams from 18 universities ($30,000)
- Letters of intent from two schools to pilot SafeGuard AI
- Sacramento State to pilot version one of our software

## Challenges
One of the main challenges was enhancing model training efficiency. By utilizing Google Cloud A100 GPU, we slashed training duration from three weeks to under 72 hours, facilitating faster iterations and deployment. 

## Future Plans
We are preparing to launch a campus-wide pilot across 50+ existing surveillance systems using RTSP streaming. Our goal is to expand SafeGuard AI to high-security facilities and public spaces.

## Speech Excerpt
**Solo Pitch for SafeGuard AI to Judges**

Good evening, judges. I'm John. I’m sure that 99% of the room knows of a person who is attending a school in the U.S. Perhaps one of your children. Frighteningly, in 2023 alone, the U.S. experienced 82 school shootings, and one of the major contributing factors is the fact that less than 1% of surveillance footage is actively monitored 24/7. Our solution, SafeGuard AI is designed to fill this critical gap in security.

SafeGuard AI employs cutting-edge AI and transformative machine learning algorithms for real-time firearm detection and instant alerts to law enforcement and school officials. With a 1ms response time, this could mean the difference between saving a life or a tragedy.

Let me show you a few snapshots of what surveillance camera feeds look like using our model. Hand out flyers of annotations at various angles. As you can see, SafeGuard AI is adaptable to any situation and any given angle. Judges, please open your pamphlets and look to the left-hand side. This is what an alert that officials would receive could look like.

Now judges, I want you to consider the market opportunity and how many lives we could save. Nearly a quarter of all active shooter incidents occur in educational institutions. We are targeting a market of over 20,000 school districts and universities in the U.S. alone.

We offer SafeGuard AI at tiered yearly subscriptions. Priced at 49 thousand per year, customers will receive yearly updates to the latest and greatest version of our AI model.

With these plans in mind and a capture rate of less than 1 percent, 10 school districts would be projecting five hundred thousand dollars in revenue. Our subscription is 20 times less than what school districts currently spend on less effective security measures. For example, the Baltimore school district spent 2.7 million on Omnilert’s system.

Compared to competitors like ZeroEyes and Omnilert, which require human intervention to confirm threats, SafeGuard AI's fully automated system offers higher reliability and efficiency. This technological edge places us at the forefront of this emerging market.

Our team has been quickly picking up traction. With only a month of development, we won two competitions, have two letters of intent from schools, and are talking to Sacramento State officials to pilot version one of our AI model.

SafeGuard AI isn’t just about schools. We envision expanding into high-security facilities and public spaces.

Judges, once again, with SafeGuard AI, you're not just evaluating a company; you're assessing the future of safety. Let's work together to create a safer, more proactive world. Thank you.
